# About this Project

This project is to fullfill the first milestone of the collaborate project for the STAT 545 course at UBC.

## Guide to Files

-   **README.md**: this file
-   **TEAMWORK.md**: The group teamwork contract, outlining our agreed terms for the project
-   **troubleshooting-1.Rmd**: A completed class-assigned exercise, which focused on correcting errors in markdown
-   **troubleshooting-1.md**: The output file of the troubleshooting Rdocument
-   **.gitignore** is used by git to avoid tracking superfluous files.

## Running the code
-   **troubleshooting-1.rmd** can be run by opening the file in Rstudio, then clicking "knit". This will re-generate **troubleshooting-1.md** as it appears in this directory.
-   The markdown files, **README.md** and **TEAMWORK.md** are best viewed in github, by clicking the relevant file.
