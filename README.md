# About this Project

This project is to fullfill the first and second milestones of the collaborative project for the STAT 545 course at UBC.

## Guide to Files

-   **README.md**: this file
-   **TEAMWORK.md**: The group teamwork contract, outlining our agreed terms for the project
-   **troubleshooting-1.Rmd** and **troubleshooting-2.Rmd**: Two completed class-assigned exercises, which focused on correcting errors in R markdown
-   **troubleshooting-1.md** and **troubleshooting-2.md**: The knit output file of the troubleshooting Rdocument
-   **.gitignore** is used by git to avoid tracking superfluous files.

## Running the code
### Required packages
If any of the following packages are not installed, run `install.packages("<package_name>")` in the R terminal
- `dslabs`
- `tidyverse`
- `stringr`
- `devtools`
- `gapminder`
Additionally, if `singer` is not installed, run `devtools::install_github("JoeyBernhardt/singer")`
### Running and viewing files
-   To run **troubleshooting-1.rmd** or **troubleshooting-2.rmd**, simply open the file in Rstudio and click "knit". This will re-generate **troubleshooting-1.md** or **troubleshooting-2.md** repsectively, as they appear in this directory.
-   The markdown files, **README.md** and **TEAMWORK.md** are best viewed in github, by clicking the relevant file.
